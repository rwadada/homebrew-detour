  # The release tarball (see scripts/build-release.mjs in the main repo) is
  # a single esbuild-bundled CLI file plus the built dashboard SPA — no
  # node_modules, no per-dependency `resource` stanzas needed here. Install
  # the whole thing into libexec and symlink the entry point into bin, so
  # it can still find its sibling `web-dist/` via `__dirname` regardless of
  # where Homebrew's Cellar happens to place it.
